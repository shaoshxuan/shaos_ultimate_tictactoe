# Shao's Ultimate TicTacToe

Ultimate TicTacToe gives the classic TicTacToe game a strategic twist. With the grid now being 9 by 9 instead of 3 by 3 (9 smaller TicTacToe grids to form the large grid), players will have to engage in more in-depth thinking to win the game as your move dictates what your opponent can do next. Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board.
